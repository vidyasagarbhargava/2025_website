    "text": "Descriptive Statistics\n• Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode, along with when each is appropriate. • Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range. • Data Distribution: Understanding normal, binomial, Poisson, and exponential distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability and Probability Distributions\n• Basic Probability: Concepts of independence, conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem, and the law of total probability. • Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Familiarity with discrete (binomial, Poisson) and continuous (normal, exponential, chi-square) distributions. • Central Limit Theorem: Understanding its implications for sampling and population estimates.\nHypothesis Testing and Statistical Inference\n• Hypothesis Testing: Null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, statistical significance, and confidence levels. • Types of Errors: Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. • Confidence Intervals: Construction and interpretation, including confidence levels and margin of error. • ANOVA and T-Tests: For comparing means across groups (independent, paired, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA).\nRegression Analysis\n• Linear Regression: Assumptions, interpretation of coefficients, R-squared, and understanding residuals. • Logistic Regression: For binary classification, interpretation of coefficients in terms of odds ratios. • Regularization Techniques: Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net to prevent overfitting in high-dimensional datasets. • Multicollinearity: Detecting and addressing multicollinearity issues.\nMultivariate Statistics\n• Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality and interpreting principal components. • Factor Analysis: Understanding latent factors in data. • Clustering: K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN for unsupervised learning. • MANOVA: Multi-way analysis of variance for multivariate response data.\nTime Series Analysis\n• Stationarity: Identifying and transforming non-stationary series. • ARIMA Models: Autoregressive, Integrated, Moving Average models for forecasting. • Seasonality and Trend Analysis: Decomposing series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. • Exponential Smoothing: For handling seasonal and trend components in time series.\nBayesian Statistics\n• Bayesian Inference: Understanding prior, likelihood, posterior distributions, and Bayes’ theorem applications. • Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Sampling methods, especially when working with complex posterior distributions. • Bayesian Networks: Directed acyclic graphs for representing probabilistic relationships.\nStatistical Quality Control and Experimental Design\n• A/B Testing: Setting up, running, and interpreting results; understanding concepts like lift, conversion rates, and sample size calculation. • Design of Experiments (DOE): Full factorial, fractional factorial, and randomized block designs. • Chi-Square Tests: For independence and goodness of fit, especially useful with categorical data.\nResampling Methods\n• Bootstrap Methods: For estimating confidence intervals and understanding distributional properties without strong parametric assumptions. • Jackknife Resampling: Used primarily to estimate bias and variance, especially in small samples.\nAdvanced Topics\n• Survival Analysis: Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-event data. • Monte Carlo Simulation: For probabilistic risk analysis and scenario testing. • Hidden Markov Models (HMM): Modeling sequences and state transitions in data, useful for time-series and sequential analysis."
